# H-1B applications system for coming registration and filling season remains unchanged

Tens of thousands of skilled immigrant request the highly sought-after H-1B visa every year, which is accessible to those with a bachelor's or higher degree along with a specialty job that requires that degree. The USCIS placed an annual limit on the number of H-1B visas issued and performs an annual lottery to select the pe randomly due to the fact that so many people request each year.

But there has been a lot of controversey in terms of H1b selection process, will it be lottery or wage determined?

> In 2020 DHS published a proposed rule to change how the H1B Visa Lottery process would work during the H1B Registration Process

But then President Biden postponed it to Dec 31, 2021 which was dated on Mar 01, 2021.

What are your thoughts ?
